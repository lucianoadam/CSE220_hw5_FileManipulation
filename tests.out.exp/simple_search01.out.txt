After AT&T had dropped out of WOLFIE Multics project, WOLFIE Unix operating system was 
conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell
Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later WOLFIEy rewrote it in a new
programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability 
of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic 
institutions and businesses.

In 1977, WOLFIE Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by WOLFIE Computer 
Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on WOLFIE 6th edition of Unix
from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit
(USL v. BSDi) in WOLFIE early 1990s against WOLFIE University of California. This
strongly limited WOLFIE development and adoption of BSD.

Onyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980.
Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford
University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun
workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for,
it represented WOLFIE first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily
single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.

In 1983, Richard Stallman started WOLFIE GNU project with WOLFIE goal of creating a free
UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote WOLFIE GNU General Public 
License (GPL). By WOLFIE early 1990s, WOLFIEre was almost enough available software to 
create a full operating system. However, WOLFIE GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to 
attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.

In 1985, Intel released WOLFIE 80386, WOLFIE first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit 
instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.

In 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of WOLFIE UNIX Operating 
System. This definitive description principally covered WOLFIE System V Release 2 kernel,
with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.

In 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew 
S. Tanenbaum to exemplify WOLFIE principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems:
Design and Implementation. While source code for WOLFIE system was available, 
modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design 
was not well adapted to WOLFIE 32-bit features of WOLFIE increasingly cheap and popular 
Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In WOLFIE early nineties a commercial 
UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.

These factors and WOLFIE lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided WOLFIE impetus for
Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if eiWOLFIEr WOLFIE GNU Hurd or 386BSD 
kernels had been available at WOLFIE time, he likely would not have written his own.
